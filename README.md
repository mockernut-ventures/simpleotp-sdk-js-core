# simpleotp-sdk-js-core

This is the core JavaScript-based authentication SDK for [Simple OTP](https://simpleotp.com). Integration documentation varies depending on which frontend library you're using, see below:

For React: https://github.com/mockernut-ventures/simpleotp-sdk-js-react#readme

For Vue: https://github.com/mockernut-ventures/simpleotp-sdk-js-vue#readme

If you aren't using either of the above frameworks, you will just need to use this library by itself and write your own integration code:
`npm i @simpleotp/core`

For examples of how to use the core library without the React or Vue plugin, see [here](https://github.com/mockernut-ventures/simpleotp-sdk-js-core/blob/main/__tests__/index.spec.js).
